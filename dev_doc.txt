Pallet Liquidation Analysis System: Software Design and Development Document

1. System Overview
   The Pallet Liquidation Analysis System is designed to automate the process of searching, analyzing, and valuing pallets from various liquidation websites. It will scrape data from these sites, compare item values using eBay data, and provide a user-friendly interface for managing and analyzing potential purchases.
2. Architecture
   The system will follow a modular, microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.
   2.1 Core Modules
   Web Scraper
   eBay Data Fetcher
   Pallet Analyzer
   Database Manager
   User Interface
   Reporting Engine
3. Data Types and Schemas
   We will use schema-driven development to ensure data consistency and integrity across the system. Each major data type will have a defined schema.
   3.1 Pallet Schema
   python
   PalletSchema = {
   "id": str,
   "source_website": str,
   "title": str,
   "description": str,
   "price": float,
   "shipping_cost": float,
   "item_count": int,
   "condition": str,
   "url": str,
   "scrape_date": datetime,
   "items": List[ItemSchema]
   }

   3.2 Item Schema
   python
   ItemSchema = {
   "name": str,
   "description": str,
   "quantity": int,
   "condition": str,
   "estimated_value": float
   }

   3.3 eBay Data Schema
   python
   EbayDataSchema = {
   "item_name": str,
   "average_sold_price": float,
   "total_sold_last_30_days": int,
   "sell_through_rate": float,
   "last_updated": datetime
   }

   3.4 Analysis Report Schema
   python
   AnalysisReportSchema = {
   "pallet_id": str,
   "total_estimated_value": float,
   "roi_percentage": float,
   "risk_score": float,
   "recommendation": str,
   "analysis_date": datetime
   }

4. Module Specifications

   Analysis Results Display
   Saved Pallets Dashboard
   4.6 Reporting Engine
   Responsibilities: Generate reports and visualizations
   Technologies: Matplotlib, Plotly
   Key Functions:
   generate_pallet_report(pallet_id: str) -> bytes
   create_performance_dashboard(user_id: str) -> Dict
5. Development Methodology
   5.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   All modules will be developed using TDD principles:
   Write a failing test
   Write the minimum code to pass the test
   Refactor the code
   Repeat
   5.2 Schema-Driven Development
   All data structures will adhere to predefined schemas, ensuring consistency and enabling automated validation.
   5.3 Iterative Development Cycle
   Planning: Define features and acceptance criteria
   Execution: Implement features using TDD
   Assessment: Review implementation and gather feedback
   Iteration: Refine and expand based on assessment
6. Testing Strategy
   6.1 Unit Tests
   Each module will have comprehensive unit tests
   Use pytest for Python modules
   Use Jest for JavaScript (React) components
   6.2 Integration Tests
   Test interactions between modules
   Use pytest for backend integration tests
   Use Cypress for frontend integration tests
   6.3 End-to-End Tests
   Simulate real user scenarios
   Use Selenium WebDriver for browser automation
   6.4 Performance Tests
   Load testing using Locust
   Stress testing for data processing modules
7. Deployment and CI/CD
   Use Docker for containerization
   Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
   Deploy to cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud)
8. Monitoring and Maintenance
   Implement logging using Python's logging module
   Use Prometheus for metrics collection
   Set up Grafana dashboards for system monitoring
9. Security Considerations
   Implement authentication and authorization
   Use HTTPS for all communications
   Regularly update dependencies
   Perform security audits
   By following this schema-driven, test-driven, iterative approach, we ensure a robust, maintainable, and efficient development process. This methodology will allow us to quickly adapt to changing requirements while maintaining high code quality and system reliability.
